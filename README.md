# Home Screen changes

There are some details on the homepage that I decided to change/add to improve the UX/UI.

### - Changed background color status to column attribute

Due to the colors chosen for the theme (Nemi's color palette), using the entire row background to indicate status could be visually overwhelming for users. A more appealing and intuitive approach would be to add a dedicated column with text labels ("active"/"inactive") and add a subtle background color.

### - Added filter by name

Once there are a lot of services created, it can become a problem if the user wants to search for an specific service to modify or delete. The solution is to add an input to allow the user to search by name.
